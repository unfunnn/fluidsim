# fluidsim
A fluid simulation based on cellular automata
## How it works
It works in a very simple way. It will check the 3 pixels under it (directly under, to the left, and to the right) and then the 2 on it's left and right. It will then move to the first place it sees. It is based on the physics system of the game "Noita" and how it works was talked about in greater detail in a GDC here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prXuyMCgbTc
## Controls
- Left click to place water
- Right click to place solid/rigid walls
- Be warned that a diagonal wall is not considered connected by the fluid and it will seep through that
